	<h1>Hi there, I'm Maayez Imam!</h1>
	<p>I'm a data science consultant at Sia Partners where I've helped Fortune 500 companies:
		allocate their $100 million+ marketing spend budgets; implement various time series
		forecasting models; create real-time dashboards, and integrate APIs into consolidated datasets.
		I have also authored and led the development of multiple internal papers and data science solutions
		that have been viewed by over 10 thousand people, led to the acquirement of over 5 new clients, 
		and brought in over $250K in revenue.</p>
	<p> I double majored in Computer Science and Economics at the University of California, Davis.
		I specialize in solving unique problems and doing data analysis through logical thought processing. 
		I hope to combine my interests in engineering and economics to pursue a career in data science, 
		quantitative analytics, or another data-related field.</p>
